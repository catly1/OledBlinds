# LetterBoxer (formerly OLEDBlinds)
![](images/comparison-resize.jpg)
Android Devices have varying screen sizes. That's why you often see static backdrops to maintain the app's aspect ratio. 

This app adds black letter boxings. The controls hide automatically after a few secs and can be locked.

You can set a toggle in the notification/quick panel or turn it on from the app directly. The height or width of the bars is automatically saved. In case the controls become inaccessible, there is a reset button in the app.

This app needs permission to Draw Over Other Apps.

## Disclaimer:
This app does not directly interact with other apps. It just draws black bars on the screen. It's the same as how Facebook messenger draws floating chat heads.
